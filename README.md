# Rosenbrock Function Optimization

This project demonstrates the optimization of the Rosenbrock function using the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function from the SciPy library and visualizes the results using `matplotlib`.

## Rosenbrock Function

The Rosenbrock function is defined as:

\[ f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b(y - x^2)^2 \]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. The function has a global minimum at \( (a, a^2) \).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

### Installing

You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
